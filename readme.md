## Tech

I'm trying to rebuild this portfolio with Claude Sonnet 4 as a little experiment. I am finding that even when I specifically ask Claude to take the content from an existing live site, it will summarize and sort of wash the content into something generically pleasing. I do like the look but it took a few tries to get there, and again it was using generic elements instead of a specific logo and background I had asked for.

## Next Steps

Refining content, blending the aesthetic with all the missing content, cleaning up the repo.
