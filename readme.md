# My Portfolio Website (v2)

This is the source code for my portfolio/professional website at [supernikole.com](https://supernikole.com/)


## Credits

The site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using a modified version of the [Stellar Gatsby Starter](https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-stellar), upgraded for Gatsby 4 and Dart-Sass.

The Gatsby.js V2 starter was based on the Stellar site template, designed by HTML5 UP. Check out [Code Bushi](https://codebushi.com/gatsby-starters-and-themes/) for more Gatsby starters and templates.

## Tech

The site uses Gatsby and Sass. Please feel free to fork [my upgraded blank](https://github.com/websupergirl/gatsby-starter-stellar) if you want to try this with Gatsby 4 on your own - that is probably easier than using this version.

## Changelog
