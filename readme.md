# My Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my portfolio/professional website at [supernikole.com](https://supernikole.com/)


## Credits

The site was created on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using a modified version of the [Start Bootstrap Resume theme](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/resume/).

## Tech

It's just html, css, and Bootstrap 5, because sometimes simple is best and we all know I'm not a designer.
