# My Portfolio Website (v2)

This is the source code for my portfolio/professional website at [supernikole.com](https://supernikole.com/)

## Installation

I would recommend that you have node 18 for this project, although [Gatsby technically still works with node 14 or 16](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/upgrading-node-js/).

You will also need the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/gatsby-cli/), currently at version 4.

```
git clone [this repo]
cd [dir]
git checkout [correct branch]
npm install
gatsby develop
```

## Credits

The site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using a modified version of the [Read Only Template](https://html5up.net/read-only), added to the [Gatsby Starter Default](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default).

## Tech

The site uses Gatsby and Sass.

## Changelog
* v3 init with gatsby-starter-default
